### Greek mythological figures

Based on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Greek_mythological_figures parsed by a regex and a lot of manual edits. If you want to try to reproduce it, download it and use a editor which can use regex to replace content to search for 

```
(?:([A-Za-z\s]*)(\[\[))|(?:(\*+\s))|\s\(.*\n|\]\].*\n|\|.*\n|===.*\n|\{\{.*\n|.*\F\i\l\e.*\n|:.*\n
```

### Country names

Based on list found on http://www.azurewebdesign.com/plain-list-of-all-countries/ .

It would problably be a good thing to change to a more "official" list of countries, but this works fine too.
